  # Personal Flask Template starter 📝  
  Created this Flask app in order to clone it and start a new project each
  time. This will save me time asking chatGPT how to start a Flask app
  for the 1.000.000.000th time.
  
  ## Get Started 🚀  
  To get Started Create a venv Virtual environment.

~~~bash  
  python -m venv venv
~~~
  ### Activate Venv

  venv\Scripts\activate
~~~
  ### Install Flask
